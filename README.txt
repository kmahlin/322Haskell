How to run this stuff.

1)I'm using the haskell platform d/l from the haskell website. It just installs.
2)I double click on the .hs file I want to run, the installed haskell platform will run the file in it's interpreter
3) to run csce322homework03part01
  - double click on the haskell file from the window browser
  - type:
    - :main part01test01.g
    - or something like, :main /pathtofile

that should do it for now.
